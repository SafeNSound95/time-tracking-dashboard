Mobile first:
grid 1 column, that has 7 cards(divs): 1 for profile card, and 6 for each activity.
the 6 div cards are the same, let's not think about the profile card for now:
each div card has two items that are flexed (Work  ...) and another two items that are flexed with flex direction being row, and having space between.
so two flex containers inside each card.
-I'm also thinking each card can be a two column grid, with the first column justified to start, and the second column justified to end(excited to try this approach instead) so the card contaienr itself is a 2 x 2 grid

profile card: 2 x 3 grid? with the first row spanning across the 3 columns, 
the first row is also a flex container.

-Desktop:
for each activity card, the grid that once was 2 x 2 becomes 3 x 2, elementary.
the profile card grid that was 2 x 3 becomes at least 4 rows with at least 2 columns(4x2)
